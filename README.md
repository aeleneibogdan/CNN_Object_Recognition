# CNN_Object_Recognition

For this project I chose CIFAR10 dataset in order to implement a Convolutional Neural Network with its task being Object Recognition.

The dataset consists in 60.000 32x32 colored images in 10 classes, each class containing 6000 images. The 60.000 images are splitted as following: 50.000 are training images and 10.000 are testing images.
The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.
